Inferring trophic interactions

This code reproduces the analysis presented in:
Pomeranz et al. Accepted. Inferring predator-prey interactions in food webs. Methods in Ecology and Evolution

The data are available at Figshare (https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/56642). 

To run the full analysis, download the data and place the files in the Data/Raw_data folder. 
The scripts should be run in order, e.g. 1_trait_matching_models.R, 1b_..., 2_..., 3_... etc. 

I will be updating the readme in the GitHub project (https://github.com/Jpomz/honestly-you-eat-this) to include an example of the analyses run here, hopefully in the next week or two. Keep your eyes peeled!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
