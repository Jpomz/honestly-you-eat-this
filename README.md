Inferring trophic interactions

This code reproduces the analysis presented in:
Pomeranz et al. Accepted. Inferring predator-prey interactions in food webs. Methods in Ecology and Evolution

The data is available at Figshare [DOI here once accepted]. 

To run the full analysis, download the data and place the files in the Data/Raw_data folder. 
The scripts should be run in order, e.g. 1_trait_matching_models.R, 1b_..., 2_..., 3_... etc. 

I will be updating this readme to include an example of the analyses run here, hopefully in the next week or two. Keep your eyes peeled!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
