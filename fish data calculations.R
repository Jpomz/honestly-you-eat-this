# fish data in originals only includes presence / absence
#downloaded all fish data from Taireri Catchment
# downloaded January 2017 from https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-services/online-services/freshwater-fish-database
# "Taieri NZ Fish datbase.csv" ~3200 rows, 22 columns

# convert fish lengths to biomass estimates 
# Formulas from Jellyman et al. NZJMFR "Does one size fit all? An evaluation of lengthâ€“weight relationships for New Zealand's freshwater fish species"

# estimate numerical abundance using metabolic theory based on body size
